    <h1>Introduction/Background:</h1>
    <p>Project: Predictive Analysis for Olympic Wins</p>
    <p>As the height of athletic achievement, the Olympic Games attract athletes from all over the world to compete in a variety of sports. Predictive models have been developed as a result of academics and analysts' fascination with predicting outcomes, such as medal distributions.</p>

    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forecasting the Olympic Medal Distribution:</strong> This study employs machine learning techniques to examine the influence of socioeconomic factors, such as a country's GDP, population, and political structure, on its Olympic success <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121314">[1]</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Heuristics Prediction of Olympic Medals Using Machine Learning:</strong> Focusing on heuristic methods, this paper explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict medal counts based on historical performance data, athlete demographics, and pre-Games expectations <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212734">[2]</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics of Performance of India in the Olympics Using Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong> This research narrows its focus to a single country, India, analyzing factors that contribute to its athletes' performances in the Olympics <a href="https://doi.org/10.30534/ijeter/2020/57852020">[3]</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The dataset under consideration, sourced from Kaggle, encompasses a wide range of information pertinent to the Olympics, including athlete demographics, performance outcomes, and country-specific data. This rich dataset provides a foundation for developing predictive models aimed at understanding and forecasting Olympic medal wins. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results">[Dataset]</a></p>

    <h2>Problem Definition:</h2>
    <p>A significant challenge within Olympic sports analytics is predicting an athlete's likelihood of securing a medal in their respective event. Various factors contribute to this complexity, including age, gender, physical attributes, and the historical backdrop of the Olympic Games. Addressing this problem is crucial for optimizing athlete performance, strategic planning, and enhancing the spectator experience.</p>

    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Enables athletes and coaches to identify and focus on key performance factors, potentially leading to improved training efficiency and competition outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Assists sports governing bodies in making informed decisions regarding the distribution of resources, prioritizing athletes with higher medal prospects.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhancing Spectator Experience:</strong> Provides fans with insights into likely medal winners, increasing engagement and interest in the Olympic Games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods:</h2>
    <p>FINISH</p>

    <h3>Data Preprocessing Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data set extension: To incorporate data from recent Olympic Games, such as Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022, into the existing dataset. This step ensures that the model is trained on the most comprehensive and up-to-date information.</li>
        <li>Handling non-medal results: To effectively utilize information from athletes who participated but did not win a medal.</li>
        <li>Cleaning Partial Entries: To ensure data integrity by addressing missing, incomplete, or inconsistent entries.</li>
    </ul>
